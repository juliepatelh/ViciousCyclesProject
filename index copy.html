  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Why Vicious Cycles?</h3>
  <br>
  <p style="font: 400 15px/1.8 Lato, sans-serif; color: #777;">When it comes to industry-leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products are what 
    you have been waiting for. We sell top-quality cycling equipment and have been doing it for years. 
    Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying us for some time. 
    Don't be fooled by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes 
    to your cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust in, 
    at a price you can afford. Of course, custom work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not 
    interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds. If you're interested in 
    discussing a fully custom or customized build, come down to our store and visit with us to find out what 
    we can really do.</p>
